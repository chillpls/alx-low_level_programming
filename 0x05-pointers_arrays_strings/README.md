## Description

The "0x05-pointers_arrays_strings" section of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum is designed to teach students about pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

- [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): Writing a C function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

- [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): Writing a C function that swaps the values of two integers.

- [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): Writing a C function that returns the length of a string.

- [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): Writing a C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.

- [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): Writing a C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c): Writing a C function that reverses a string.

- [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): Writing a C function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

- [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c): Writing a C function that prints the second half of a string.

- [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): Writing a C function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c): Writing a C function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`'\0'`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
