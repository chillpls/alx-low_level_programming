## Description

The "0x04-more_functions_nested_loops" section of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum is designed to teach students more advanced concepts of functions and nested loops in C.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

- [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): Writing a C function that checks for uppercase characters.

- [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c): Writing a C function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).

- [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c): Writing a C function that multiplies two integers.

- [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c): Writing a C function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

- [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c): Writing a C function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, except `2` and `4`, followed by a new line.

- [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): Writing a C function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `14`, ten times, followed by a new line.

- [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): Writing a C function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

- [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c): Writing a C function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

- [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c): Writing a C function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

- [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): Writing a C program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

- [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c): Writing a C function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
