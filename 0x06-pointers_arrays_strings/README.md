## Description

The "0x06-pointers_arrays_strings" section of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum is designed to teach students about more advanced concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

- [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c): Writing a C function that concatenates two strings.

- [1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c): Writing a C function that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from `src`.

- [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c): Writing a C function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte (`'\0'`), using at most `n` bytes.

- [3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c): Writing a C function that compares two strings.

- [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): Writing a C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c): Writing a C function that reverses a string.

- [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): Writing a C function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

- [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c): Writing a C function that prints the second half of a string.

- [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): Writing a C function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c): Writing a C function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`'\0'`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

- [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c): Writing a C function that converts a string to an integer.

- [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c): Writing a C program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
