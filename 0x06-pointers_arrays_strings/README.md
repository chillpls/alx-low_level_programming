## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

- [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c): Writing a C function that concatenates two strings.

- [1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c): Writing a C function that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from `src`.

- [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c): Writing a C function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte (`'\0'`), using at most `n` bytes.
