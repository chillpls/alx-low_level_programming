## Description

The "0x08-recursion" section of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum is designed to teach students about recursion in C.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

- [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c): Writing a C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.

- [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c): Writing a C function that prints a string, in reverse, using recursion.

- [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c): Writing a C function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

- [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c): Writing a C function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

- [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c): Writing a C function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.

- [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c): Writing a C function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

- [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c): Writing a C function that checks if a given number is a prime number using recursion.

- [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c): Writing a C function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

- [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c): Writing a C function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns `0`. The function can compare a string that contains the special character `*`, which can replace any string (including an empty string).
